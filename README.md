# CREA-ZA_metabarcoding-grana
Metabarcoding analysis on Grana cheese, by CREA-ZA research group (Lodi, Italy)

This repository contains the post-sequencing analysis (OTU filtering, clustering, differential analysis) as described in the paper 

[Zago, Miriam, et al. "Evaluation of bacterial communities of Grana Padano cheese by DNA metabarcoding and DNA fingerprinting analysis." Food Microbiology 93: 103613.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002020302021)

The scripts are released under MIT licence and are available for reproducibility. All scripts expect metabarcoding data to be put in a /data subfolder. At the time of writing (July 2020) the original data will not be released and are available on request (write to dr. Giorgio Giraffa giorgio.giraffa@crea.gov.it).
