# CREA-ZA_metabarcoding-grana
Metabarcoding analysis on Grana cheese, by CREA-ZA research group (Lodi, Italy)

This repository contains the post-sequencing analysis (OTU filtering, clustering, differential analysis) as described in the upcoming paper "Evaluation of bacterial communities of Grana Padano cheese by DNA metabarcoding and DNA fingerprinting analysis", Zago et al.

The scripts are released under MIT licence and are available for reproducibility. All scripts expect metabarcoding data to be put in a /data subfolder. At the time of writing (July 2020) the original data will not be released and are available on request (write to dr. Giorgio Giraffa giorgio.giraffa@crea.gov.it).
